# Course slides using Jupyter notebooks

## Setting up virtual environments

This script also activates the jupyter notebook extensions that are needed.

```sh
source build_venv.sh
```

The reason to use `source` is to bring the activated `venv` into your shell.

The virtual environment will be a hidden directory called `.venv`.
